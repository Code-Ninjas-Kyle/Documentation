- @MatrixSenpai or @ctphillips will send the project out to be ninjafied
- Set up and perform a dry run
- @MatrixSenpai and @ctphillips will perform a final review and send to corporate for review
- @MatrixSenpai will perform a release on GitHub

### Process Explained
Each camp should have a folder called `Progress` that contains the following files:
- abstract.md
- objectives.md
- writeup.md
These correspond to the abstract, objectives outline, and write up phases of the process.

Once the write up has been ninjafied, there should be three  files in the Camp Kit:
- Sensei Kit.pdf
- Ninja Kit - Landscape.pdf
- Ninja Kit - Portrait.pdf

###### Abstract
This should be a general idea of what the camp should be focused on, materials and programming languages to use, and any other abstract details that pertain to the camp.

###### Kickoff Meeting
A planned meeting to discuss the abstract provided and rank its priority.

###### Objectives Outline
Create a general outline that defines the projects that should include the concept for the ninja to learn

###### Break Out
Create a detailed outline that defines the projects, difficulty for each project, and any additional projects or extra steps for them to take. This should contain _most_ if not _all_ the content for them to learn
